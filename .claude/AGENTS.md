* When running any python code or tool, including the below, `source .venv/bin/activate` first.
* Use `uv` for package management.
* Run `ty check .` and `ruff format .` and `ruff check . --fix` after writing code.
* Avoid defensive programming. To the extent possible, rely on the type system for guarantees instead.
* Ask questions if your instructions are unclear.
