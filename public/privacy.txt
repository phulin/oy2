  regarding your account or certain features of the application(s). If
  you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications, you

This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our
internal analytics and reporting purposes.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete,
and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal
information.

2.  HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and
administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud
prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information
for other purposes with your consent.

We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending
on how you interact with our Services, including:

- To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage
  user accounts. We may process your information so you can create and
  log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.

- To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user. We may
  process your information to provide you with the requested service.

this section and/or with the following third parties.

We may need to share your personal information in the following
situations:

- Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in

  company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
  business to another company.

4.  DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect
and store your information.

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services.
Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our
Services and your account , prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your
preferences, and assist with basic site functions.

We also permit third parties and service providers to use online
tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising,
including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor
advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart
reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third
parties and service providers use their technology to provide
advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which
may appear either on our Services or on other websites.

To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a
"sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under
the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of
these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described
below under section " DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY
RIGHTS? "

Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can
refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice .

5.  HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill
the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required
by law.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a
longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
of time in which users have an account with us .

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
processing until deletion is possible.

6.  HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system
of organizational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
information, transmission of personal information to and from our
Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
a secure environment.

7.  DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children
under 18 years of age .

under 18 years of age , nor do we knowingly sell such personal
information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
may have collected from children under age 18 , please contact us at
contact@oyme.site .

8.  WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent
depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section " HOW
CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE? " below .

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

Account Information

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
your account or terminate your account, you can:

- Contact us using the contact information provided.

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
delete your account and information from our active databases. However,

terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept
cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your
browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove
cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or
services of our Services.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may
email us at contact@oyme.site .

9.  CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
applications include a Do-Not-Track ( "DNT" ) feature or setting you can
activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
has been finalized . As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
them at this time.

Global Privacy Control: We recognize and honor Global Privacy Control
(GPC) signals. If you use a browser or extension that supports GPC, we
will treat this as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of
your personal information for targeted advertising purposes under
applicable state privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy
Act (CCPA). When we detect a GPC signal from your browser, we will
automatically apply your opt-out preference without requiring you to
take any additional action. For more information about GPC and how to
enable it, visit globalprivacycontrol.org.
