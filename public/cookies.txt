COOKIE POLICY

Last updated February 11, 2026

Oy uses only essential storage needed to run the app and website.

We do not sell your private data. We do not use advertising cookies. We do not use third-party tracking cookies for cross-site profiling.

1) What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed on your device by a website. They help websites remember information across requests and visits.

We also use similar browser storage technologies (like localStorage), which are not technically cookies but are often discussed together in cookie policies.

2) What this policy covers

This policy explains cookies and similar browser storage used by Oy at https://oyme.site and in the app experience.

3) Why we use storage

We use storage only to:
- keep you signed in,
- keep core app data available between reloads,
- remember limited app preferences needed for app behavior,
- avoid duplicate notification handling.

4) No non-essential tracking cookies

Oy does not set non-essential cookies for ads, behavioral profiling, or cross-site tracking.

5) First-party and third-party cookies

Oy uses first-party essential storage for core app functionality. Oy does not use third-party advertising cookies.

6) How to control cookies

Most browsers let you block or delete cookies in browser settings. If you block essential cookies, parts of Oy may stop working correctly.

Because we currently use only essential cookie/storage items, there is no separate opt-in banner for non-essential cookies at this time.

7) Other tracking technologies

Websites can also use similar technologies such as localStorage. This policy includes those technologies where used by Oy.

8) Storage inventory (plain English)

Essential cookie:
- session
  - What it does: keeps your authenticated session active after sign-in.
  - Why it is essential: required for secure login and account access.
  - Type: first-party, secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict.
  - Duration: up to 1 year unless you log out or the session is ended.

Essential localStorage keys:
- cachedUser
  - What it does: stores basic signed-in user data so the app can load faster.
- cachedFriends
  - What it does: stores your friend list cache for faster startup.
- cachedLastOyInfo
  - What it does: stores recent Oy/Lo summary data used in the main feed.
- seenNotificationIds
  - What it does: stores recent notification IDs to avoid showing duplicates.
- passkeySetupSkipped
  - What it does: remembers if you skipped passkey setup so the app does not keep prompting immediately.
- locationExplainerSeen
  - What it does: remembers if you already saw the Lo location explainer modal.

9) Policy updates

We may update this policy when our storage usage changes for operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The date at the top shows the latest update.
