* Use `yarn` for package management.
* Run `yarn check && yarn lint:fix && yarn format:fix` after writing code.
* Avoid defensive programming. To the extent possible, rely on the type system for guarantees instead.
* Ask questions if your instructions are unclear.
* The current production schema is stored in `production_schema.sql`. Keep it updated if you add database migrations.
